	<h3>The most awesomest school around</h3>
		<p>During my high school years I went to a private school in Houston called the Houston Outdoor Learning Academy. The school was small, at most we had around 15 students. As the name implies, the focus of the school was education through the outdoors. As part of our daily routine we went outside and DID something! It was great and I learned a lot. I was able to find a copy of the school website with the <a href="http://www.web.archive.org" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070928192326/http://www.holainfo.com/" target="_blank">HOLA</a>.<br></p>

		<p>Unfortunately the school closed a few years ago. The amazing founders, Dan and Laura, put everything they had into the school. Sometimes this meant that they paid for an experience for the students over paying for their electricity. They gave out scholarships to students who were passionate about learning and doing, at their own expense. I was a recipient of one of these scholarships. When they had their first child I think that this became was too much for them to handle and they were forced to close the school.<br></p>

		<p>A central part of the school year were the two trips we took, one would always be a couple week long backpacking trip somewhere in the US. The other was a couple of weeks spent in another country. We went backpacking in the Fall and traveled the world in the Spring. Those experiences were some of the best, most influential, experiences of my life. I tell my kids stories from these years, and often think of the amazing things I was able to see and do with HOLA.<br></p>

		<p>Here are some of my memories from a handful of these trips:<br></p>
