	<h3>The most awesomest school around</h3>
		<p>During my high school years I went to a private school in Houston called the Houston Outdoor Learning Academy. As the name implies, the focus of the school was education through the outdoors. As part of our daily routine we went outside and DID something! It was great and I learned a lot.<br></p>

		<p>One time we went out into the woods, which in Houston means hot and humid and mosquitos. But we went out anyways! We built a little sweat lodge and played with sticks and knives, it was awesome.<br></p>

		<p>A central part of the school year were the two trips we took, one would always be a couple week long backpacking trip somewhere in the US. The other was a couple of weeks spent in another country. We went backpacking in the Fall and travelled the world in the Spring. Those experiences were some of the best, most influential, experiences of my life.<br></p>

		<p>Here are a couple of my memories from a handful of these trips:<br></p>
